    <h4>What is a Personal Portfolio Website?</h4>
    <p>
      A Personal Portfolio Website is a professional website that provides information about what I do, what services
      I offer and how to contact me. Portfolio website is an easy way to promote myself. It is a unique way to showcase
      my work and let others know about me. A website portfolio will help me stand out from the crowd, show my
      uniqueness, help me build trust and as well make sure that others can actually find me. Having my own website means
      employers are always able to find me and if interested, reach out to me.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Purpose of My Personal Portfolio Website
    </h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to showcase the professionalism in my work to potential employers and clients to
      view and then get hired. The website is also intended to help highlight my best features even if I have minimal

      About

    <h4>
      About me
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jennifer Ebere and I am an upcoming web developer with minimal experience in Lagos, Nigeria.
      Currently, I am on the path of completing my degree course in Applied Technology in Brigham Young
      University-Idaho. For starters, I am not a full-stack web developer yet but I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, 
      JavaScript and Python Programming Language. I am a young woman who have once visioned herself as a lady-programmer 
      and that is the path I am in currently. I love traveling and visiting new places. I love fun as a person. I enjoy 
      trying to write codes and see that it is actually working no matter how many errors I make while trying to get the 
      code to work. I play games a whole lot as well (Hoping to be able to build a gaming app pretty soon). I dislike 
      gossipers, likewise people who put others down simply because they are inferior to them. I also dislike people who 
      do not see the best in others. What interests me the most about being a web-developer is me being able to solve 
      problems and also develop working applications. At the moment, I do not have a professional story to tell as I have 
      not developed nor worked on anything that I will term as professional.
    </p>

    <h4>
      My Values
    </h4>
    <p>
    My values are the things that I believe are important in the way I live and work. They do determine my priorities
    and most times they are the measures I use to tell if my life is turning out the way I want and a few of my values 
    are as follows:
    •	Dependability
    •	Authenticity
    •	Honesty
    •	Kindness
    •	Trustworthy
    •	Responsibility
    •	Modesty
    •	Self-respect
    •	Friendly
    •	Open-minded
    •	Integrity
    •	Trust
    •	Peace
    •	Communication
    •	Love <br>
    These are some of the most important value I live by everyday of my life.
  </p>

    <h4>
      My Best Work
    </h4>
    <p>
    A portfolio is not just for archiving my work. It is for showing the project I am most proud of in the best light
    possible. Currently, this portfolio website will be one of my best works to be recorded. This project is still in
    progress. The goal of the project is to have a portfolio website that can be shown to future employers. The project
    duration is to get this site ready before the last week of the course. My role in this project is that I am
    personally handling the project. This is an independent project that I will someday be proud of. Right now, I have no
    picture to show as I have not gotten the final result overview but in few weeks, I will show my final result.
