        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Ebere and I am an upcoming web developer with minimal experience in Lagos,
          Nigeria.
          Currently, I am on the path of completing my degree course in Applied Technology in Brigham Young
          University-Idaho. For starters, I am not a full-stack web developer yet but I have basic knowledge of HTML,
          CSS,
          JavaScript and Python Programming Language. I am a young woman who have once visioned herself as a
          lady-programmer
          and that is the path I am in currently. I love traveling and visiting new places. I love fun as a person. I
          enjoy
          trying to write codes and see that it is actually working no matter how many errors I make while trying to get
          the
          code to work. I play games a whole lot as well (Hoping to be able to build a gaming app pretty soon). I
          dislike
          gossipers, likewise people who put others down simply because they are inferior to them. I also dislike people
          who
          do not see the best in others. What interests me the most about being a web-developer is me being able to
          solve
          problems and also develop working applications. At the moment, I do not have a professional story to tell as I
          have
          not developed nor worked on anything that I will term as professional.</p>

      <section class="values">
        <h3>My Values</h3>
        <p>My values are the things that I believe are important in the way I live and work. They do determine my
          priorities
          and most times they are the measures I use to tell if my life is turning out the way I want and a few of my
          values
          are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Dependability</li>
          <li> Authenticity</li>
          <li> Honesty</li>
          <li> Kindness</li>
          <li> Trustworthy</li>
          <li> Responsibility</li>
          <li> Modesty</li>
          <li> Self-respect</li>
          <li> Friendly</li>
          <li> Open-minded</li>
          <li> Integrity</li>
          <li> Trust</li>
          <li> Peace</li>
          <li> Communication</li>
          <li> Love</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        These are some of the most important value I live by everyday of my life.</p>

        <h4>My Best Work</h4>
        <p> A portfolio is not just for archiving my work. It is for showing the project I am most proud of in the best
          light possible. Currently, this portfolio website will be one of my best works to be recorded. This project is
          still in progress. The goal of the project is to have a portfolio website that can be shown to future
          employers.
          The project duration is to get this site ready before the last week of the course. My role in this project is
          that I am personally handling the project. This is an independent project that I will someday be proud of.
          Right
          now, I have no picture to show as I have not gotten the final result overview but in few weeks, I will show my
          final result.</p>
