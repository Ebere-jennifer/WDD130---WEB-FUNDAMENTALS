  <h2>Jennifer Chikaodi Ebere</h2>
  <h2>Jodie</h2>
  <p>Heyy people! My name is Jennifer but you can call me Jodie. I live in Lagos, Nigeria. Right now, I am on the path of completeing my degree course in Applied Technology.</p>
  <p>I love traveling and visiting new places. I love fun as a person. I enjoy watching movies; I can do this for straight hours without getting tired. I love eating and sleeping.
    Those are very important. For games, I play whot, ludo, scrabble, and anything entertaining on my mobile phone.</p>
  <p>At the moment, I am single, yet to be married. No children just yet.
  <p>I am currently un-employed but hoping to get a job soon. One good thing I love about BYU-Idaho is that it is a place of learning.
    It provides students like me with opportunities to be independent and it teaches me to rely on Heavenly Father for help while being commited to live the gospel. I am currently pursuing a degree in Applied Technology.</p>
  <p>The world is evolving. Technology has actually taken over. So it is necessary to be aware of the trend and with the knowledge I will get as I delve more into this course,
     it will broaden my horizon and expand my intelligence on everything I need to know about web development.</p>
  <p>I have long been a member of the church from child birth; meaning I am a child of record. One of my favorite quote is from President Thomas S. Monson and it says, "Let us not demean or belittle. Rather, let us be compassionate and encouraging. Blame keeps wounds open. Only forgiveness heals."</p>   
  <p>I currently hold 3 different church callings. I am my ward's Historian, I am the first counselor in the ward primamry presidency and I am the Music Specialist in my Stake. I know Heavenly Father will give me the strength I need to push through all this callings.</p>
  <p>I'm looking forward to knowing each and everyone of you. Thank you for reading through.</p>
