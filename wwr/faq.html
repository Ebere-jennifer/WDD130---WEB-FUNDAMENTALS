          <p class="quote">&#8226; Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</p>
          <p class="story">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.
            We have found however that children over the age of
            8 seem to enjoy it more. A common concern we get
            from parents is that their children will be bored stuck
            on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal
            with very few bored children of any age. The areas
            we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful
            in the world, and you never know what you might see
            around any corner. Each boat also comes equipped
            with a guide who never runs out of stories to keep
            the interest of the children burning. </p>

          <p class="quote2">&#8226; What is included in the trip?</p>
          <p class="story2">We will provide all necessary camping equipment.
            This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof
            duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot,
            eating utensils and camping chair. We provide water
            and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot
            chocolate are provided during the morning and
            evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft
            drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). 3
            meals per day, plus snacks inclusive. </p>

          <p class="quote1">&#8226; Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim!<br> Can I still come?</p>
          <p class="story1">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed ele-
            ment of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in
            Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting expe-
            rience. The most common injuries are sun burns and injuries that
            occur on land. Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a
            great time. Your guide will give you an in-depth safety talk before
            your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in
            the event.</p>

          <p class="quote4">&#8226; What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</p>
          <p class="story4">Are you kidding me! What's not great about
            whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day
            on the river. Arise in the soft light of the early
            morning after a night spent sleeping under a
            beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast
            of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelette, then pack
            your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled
            with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms,
            hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food.
            We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up
            your cot you can relax with a good book or watch
            the rivers moving back and forth, or rather explore
            around the camp while your guides prepare your
            dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes,
            or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you
            won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner
            it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to
            talk your guide into another story or two to send you
            off to bed under more stars than you thought were
            possible.</p>

          <p class="quote3">&#8226; What do I need to bring?</p>
          <p class="story3">Bring something comfortable to wear around camp like rain jackets
            and rain pants, shirts and shorts (either short or long), two pieces of
            swim suits for both male and female, sunglasses, sandals or water
            shoes. Cotton dresses, skirts, etc are all popular options. For sleep
            wear, you might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you
            might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. Water bottle,
            small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight,
            sunscreen and lip balm. For optional items: gloves, fleece jacket, towel
            bandana, small pillow. For hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush,
            tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or
            contact lens, biodegradable soap and shampoo, camera equipment
            book, water colors, journal and pen.</p>

          <p class="quote5">&#8226; How far in advance should I book my trip?</p>
          <p class="story5">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in
            advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually
            sufficient. It is done this way to aid adequate preparation.</p>
